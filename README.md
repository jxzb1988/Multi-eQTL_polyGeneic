# Multi-eQTL_polyGeneic
For this package, I'm trying to develop a Bayesian method to perform multiple eQTL detection with a control for population structure or relatedness when the phenotype has a polygenetic background
In human eQTL study, the data with largest sample size usually contain samples from diverse populations or even related individuals, for example, Framingham Heart Study has >5000 samples with both genotype and expression data available, however, it is sampled from two generations. To use this kind of data, I develop this package. 
Part of the codes used to import data or post-processing are adapted from CAVIAR code developed by Hormozdiari. F.
